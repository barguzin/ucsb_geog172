````{caution}
This lab will provide an opportunity to practice inferential statistics in Python. Please start by opening [this Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1waie4zvnE4Vc6rDYcDDzJ_u1ixrmKmEv?usp=sharing) and copying it to your Google Drive.

## Lab Instructions

1. Pre-load 'taxis' data set from Seaborn (already pre-loaded in GC template) 
2. Create histograms and QQ-plots for the following variables: *distance, fare, tip, total*
3. Test whether the mean tip on the trip is $\mu \leq 2$ dollars. 
4. Compare mean of *total* depending on the type of payment (*total_payment*)
5. Compare whether mean distance (*distance*) is different for all pick-up boroughs. 
6. Compare whether mean tips (*tip*) is different for all drop-off boroughs. 
7. Create scatter plots for distance versus fare. Calculate correlation of this relationship. 
8. Print your GC to pdf and submit to GauchoSpace.
