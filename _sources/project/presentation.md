# Presentation

Now that you submitted both the *Data Report* and *Interim Report*, the next destination is the *Presentation*. The presentation should aim to tell a story about the dataset that you have been working with this entire quarter. The presentation is 10% of your final course grade, of which 90% comes from the presentation and response to questions and 10% comes from the feedback report (see the corresponding section below). 


````{warning}
The presentations will take place during Week 10.
