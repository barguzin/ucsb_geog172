# Lab 8: Clustering (optional) 

````{caution}
This lab will provide you with an opportunity to practice clustering in Python. We will be working with Guerry moral statistics data, that we already came across when studying LISA. Please start by opening [this Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1T-uQvaSodfUHqJUrdK3KnBlX8oxQ9PHk?usp=sharing) and copying it to your Google Drive. 
````

````{important}
Please work off of the examples in the Google Colab notebook above. 
````

````{warning}
There is no need to submit the lab.

## Instructions 

1. Import the Guerry data into Python (see the code in the template) 
2. Use the elbow and Silhoette method to identify the optimal number of clusters for k-Means clustering. 
3. Modify the code to run the AHC on the data
4. Report the optimal number of clusters for K-Means and AHC.
