# Syllabus 

## GEOG 172: Intermediate Geographical Data Analysis 

### Course Description and Objectives
This course builds on introductory level probability and statistics, focusing on analysis
involving geographical data. There is a lab accompanying the course, requiring the use of
statistical software (**Python**) for analyzing various spatial data types.

Fundamental methods used in quantitative geographic research will be covered. The
primary objectives of this course are to: 

1. Introduce students to a range of useful
approaches that may be helpful in geographic inquiry; 
2. Detail both theory and use of
presented techniques; 
3. Provide a basis for understanding more advanced spatial data analysis methods.

### Prerequisites
Coursework: Statistics and Applied Probability 5AA-ZZ or Ecology, Evolution & Marine
Biology 30 or Psychology 5 or Communication 87, or equivalents.

````{attention}
While this is not a coding class, certain familiarity with programming environment is recommended, but not required. The students  should be able to re-use and understand the code given during lectures and labs.
````

### Evaluation / Assessment

1. Labs (40%): weekly lab assignments will provide students with practical skills on
data processing and analysis. There will be a total of 8 labs in a quarter. 
2. Project (30%): the geographical analysis project will have four deliverables (data report [5%], interim report [5%], presentation [10%], and final report[10%]).
3. Quizzes (20%): weekly quizzes will be based on lecture material and contain both multiple choice and short answer questions. The lowest quiz will be dropped. 
4. Class participation (10%). Attendance of labs and lectures is required to understand the complex statistical concepts taught in class.

### Labs 

The labs will teach you practical skills on how to process and analyze spatial and spatio-temporal data. The labs will utilize Google Colab, which allows writing and executing Python code in your browser with zero configuration. The notebook environment is highly interactive and allows to streamline typical spatial analysis tasks, while also allowing to document your code and present it out-of-the-box. 

The labs are held once a week on Monday and Tuesday. The attendance is taken and is counted towards your participation grades. 

The labs from the previous week must be submitted before the start of the lab section the following week. The labs must be submitted as exported *.html* Colab notebook. The labs must be submitted via GauchoSpace dropboxes. 

````{warning}
**1% of your total grade** will be deducted for each hour late. For instance, for the lab that was submitted 1 day (24 hours) late, 24% will be deducted. Please make sure to contact your TA well in advance if you need an extension on your lab assignments.

### Project

The *Geographical Analysis Project* will provide the students with an opportunity to conduct hands-on analysis of real world data. The students will apply analytical skills acquired during the lectures in practice by generating a series of deliverables typical of on-the-job assignments for GIS Analysts. The projects must be submitted and presented individually. 

The project will have four deliverables: 
- Data Report (5%) 
- Interim Progress Report (5%) 
- Presentation (10%) 
- Final Report (10%) 

````{note} More information will be provided and made available as we get closer to due dates for deliverables.

### Quizzes

The quizzes will be delivered remotely on Thursdays via GauchoSpace. The quiz will open at 8AM and close at midnight. Once you start taking the quiz you will have 30 minutes to complete it. Please make sure that you click 'submit' to record your answers after finishing the quiz.

### Participation

Participation in both lectures and labs is crucial for learning new concepts and interactive analytical environment in this course. Please make sure to attend all lectures and labs to get good grades in the course.

### Academic Integrity

University Regulation 102.01 establishes academic misconduct as "dishonesty such as cheating, plagiarism, altering graded examinations for additional credit, or having another person take an examination for you." [The policy on academic integrity at UCSB](http://judicialaffairs.sa.ucsb.edu/AcademicIntegrity.aspx) states that "it is expected that all UCSB students will support the ideal of academic integrity and that they will be
responsible for the integrity of their work." See the instructor if you have any questions
concerning academic integrity. Sanctions for academic dishonesty include exclusion from
the course (i.e. failing the entire course) and referral to the Student-Faculty Committee on
Student Conduct.

### COVID-19 Policy 

Please refer to the dedicated [UCSB COVID-19 response website](https://www.ucsb.edu/COVID-19-information) to get most up-to-date regulations and developments on campus.
