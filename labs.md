# Labs 

The labs will teach you practical skills on how to process and analyze spatial and spatio-temporal data. The labs will utilize [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), which enables writing and executing Python code in your browser with zero configuration. The notebook environment is highly interactive and allows to streamline typical spatial analysis tasks, while also allowing to document your code and present it out-of-the-box.

The labs are held once a week on Monday and Tuesday. The attendance is taken and is counted towards your participation grades. 

The labs from the previous week must be submitted before the start of the lab section the following week. Please submit your finished work as exported *.html* Colab notebook via GauchoSpace dropboxes.
